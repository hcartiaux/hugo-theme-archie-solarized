# Archie-solarized - Hugo theme

Archie-solarized is a minimal and clean theme for hugo with a markdown-ish UI.

Forked from [Ahtul Archie Theme](https://github.com/athul/archie), it supports a dark and light mode strictly based on the [Solarized color scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/), and adds support for tables of contents.

The solarized color scheme is ideal for switching between dark and light modes, the contrast between the background and foreground is symmetrical.
It lowers the average brightness, but preserve the hues, and overall is less aggressive to my eyes than the traditional terminal color scheme.

## Demo

[Check the Demo](https://hcartiaux.github.io/), I use this theme for my sysadmin notes :smile:
